# AirBnB clone - The console
Command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

What’s a command interpreter?
Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

## Tests

Python Unit Tests

- All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
- All your test files and folders should start by test_
- Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
- e.g., For models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
- e.g., For models/user.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_user.py
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
- You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
